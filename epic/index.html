<h2>Use Case & Interaction Flow:</h2>

<p2>
    Recently affected by the pandemic, Lucy's friend group started getting into
    virtual board games and have now suggested she get it too and join them on game nights. As a new user,
    she wants to purchase the card game UNO so she can play with all her acquaintances and friends.
    To do this, once she's activated her account, installed the client and typed 'UNO' into the search bar and
    hits ENTER;
</p2>

<p4>
    *Steam takes her to a store page within the site, displaying a long list of relevant results*
</p4>

    <p5>
        she'll need to click on the particular result she's sea
        rching for. Her friend Tyler said it would be the one
        on the very top of the page. She clicks on this result.
    </p5>

<p6>
    *Steam opens up the purchase page of that particular game, displaying trailers, user feedback & pricing
</p6>

    Once Ms. Sterling decides this is the product she's looking for, she clicks the "Add to Cart" button

    and hits the "Confirm Purchase" selector. Vuala!

            After successful use of this service, Lucy uses this site frequently and with ease. Around 4 times per week.
